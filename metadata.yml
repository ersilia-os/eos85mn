Title: FARM functional group-aware molecular representations
Description: FARM is a molecular representation model that including functional group-aware
  tokenization, bridging the gap between SMILES and natural language. FARM has been
  benchmarked in the MoleculeNet dataset (SOTA in 10/12 tasks) and contains atom-level
  and molecule-level embeddings. In the current model, we offer the molecule-level
  embeddings from FARM.
